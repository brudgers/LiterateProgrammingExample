** Literate Programming Example

This is an example of Literate Programming using Racket's `scribble/lp`
module. The only reason for this README.md is to point you to the
code itself - the tangled form is above in the files
`LPexample.rkt` and `Lpexample.scrbl`. The woven form though, is
probably a better place to start and is provided as the [`gh-pages`
companion to this repository.](http://brudgers.github.io/LiterateProgrammingExample/)
